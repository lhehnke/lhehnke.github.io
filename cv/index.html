    <p class="lead">What's (usually) not on my CV</p>
    
       <p>As a child I participated in the German Youth Chess Championship in Oberhof 1999 after winning both the Palatinate and Rhineland-Palatinate Youth Championships (and decided to end my competitive streak right then and there).</p>
       
       <p>Together with two friends, I was awarded a RÖMPP student prize in chemistry by the Thieme Publishing Group in 2006 for our research project on the analysis, characterization, and synthesis of selected polymers in athletic shoes.</p>
    
       <p>Before and during my time at university I volunteered on a dementia ward, at an elementary school, in a shelter for homeless people, and in a local hospice.</p>
