As of lately, both web scraping and criminology really caught my interest and I've been planning on exploiting the synergy effects of the two topics for quite a while now. To make a long story short, this initial idea has now resulted in a rather extensive data set on executions in the United States during the 19th century, containing biographical and juridical information on executed criminals (N = 5455). You can access and download the data set <a href="https://github.com/lhehnke/crime-data">here</a>.

This blog post covers scraping the raw data from its <a href="http://deathpenaltyusa.org/">source</a>, processing it, and creating some choropleth maps and basic visualizations using `tmap` and `ggplot2`. 

In addition to the standard choropleth map, I gave Joseph Bailey's <a href="https://github.com/jbaileyh/geogrid">geogrid package</a> for turning spatial polygons into hexagonal grids a try, yielding this fancy-looking map of the total number of executions in the US from 1801 to 1900:

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lhehnke/lhehnke.github.io/master/img/death-penalty/Executions_1801-1900_hex.png" width="652px" height="260x" vspace="50px"/></p>

And if you're interested in reproducing this map, here you go!

## Setup

To keep it short this time: The usual explanation for both the required packages and `p_load()` applies. On top of that, you have to install `geogrid` from <a href="https://github.com/jbaileyh/geogrid">GitHub</a> with `devtools`.

```r
# Install geogrid from GitHub
## Source: https://github.com/jbaileyh/geogrid
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("jbaileyh/geogrid")

# Install and load packages using pacman
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
library(pacman)

p_load(geogrid, magrittr, maptools, raster, rvest, tidyverse, tmap)
```

## Scraping data from the web

The `rvest` package provides a convenient way to scrape information from web pages. You can easily create an html document from a URL with `read_html()` and select the parts of the document you'd like to extract with `html_nodes()`, using either `CSS` or `XPath` selectors. You can locate these nodes by right clicking on the respective web page, selecting *inspect element* and C&Ping the path. Alternatively, you can use <a href="http://selectorgadget.com/">SelectorGadget</a>. 

Historical data on executions in the US can be scraped from <a href="http://deathpenaltyusa.org/">deathpenaltyusa.org</a>. Since I wanted to extract tables from multiple pages at once, I followed <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40140133/scraping-tables-on-multiple-web-pages-with-rvest-in-r">this approach</a> by creating the URLs first and then looping over them with `lapply()` to download the tables. Initially, this looked quite promising, but it turned out to be a bit more complex due to different XPaths. In the end, I came up with this rather functional code (if somebody knows a more elegant solution, please let me know):

```r
# Create URL for each year
years <- seq(from = 1801, to = 1900, 1)
urls <- paste0("http://deathpenaltyusa.org/usa1/date/", years, ".htm") 

# Scrape tables
get_table <- function(url) {
  url %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes(xpath = "/html/body/div[8]/table") %>% 
    html_table(header = TRUE, fill = TRUE) 
} 

death_penalty <- lapply(urls, get_table)

# Create URLs for missing years and scrape corresponding tables
years_missing <- c("1864", "1877", "1878", "1879", "1880", "1881", "1882", "1883", "1892", "1893", "1894", "1895", "1896", "1897", "1898")
years_missing2 <- c("1848", "1876", "1891")

urls_missing <- paste0("http://deathpenaltyusa.org/usa1/date/", years_missing, ".htm") 
urls_missing2 <- paste0("http://deathpenaltyusa.org/usa1/date/", years_missing2, ".htm") 

get_table_missing <- function(url) {
  url %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes(xpath = "/html/body/div[2]/table") %>% 
    html_table(header = TRUE, fill = TRUE) 
}  

get_table_missing2 <- function(url) {
  url %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes(xpath = "/html/body/div[1]/table[2]") %>% 
    html_table(header = TRUE, fill = TRUE) 
}  

death_penalty_missing <- lapply(urls_missing, get_table_missing)
death_penalty_missing2 <- lapply(urls_missing2, get_table_missing2)
```

## Data wrangling

After scraping the data from the web, some processing needed to be done.  

```r
# Convert lists to data.frame
death_penalty_df <- do.call(rbind, lapply(c(death_penalty, death_penalty_missing, death_penalty_missing2), data.frame))

# Convert strings to lowercase
death_penalty_df %<>% 
  rename_all(tolower) %>%
  mutate_all(tolower)

# Rename columns
colnames(death_penalty_df) <- c("id", "name", "age", "race", "sex", "occupation", "crime", "method", "month", "day", "year", "state", "st")      

# Remove blank lines
death_penalty_df <- subset(death_penalty_df, !is.na(id)) 

# Change class to numeric
death_penalty_df[, c("day", "year")] <- lapply(death_penalty_df[, c("day", "year")], as.numeric)

# Replace ? and blanks with unknown
death_penalty_df %<>%
  mutate_all(funs(gsub("\\?", "unknown", .))) %>%
  mutate_all(funs(gsub("^$", "unknown", .))) 

# Sort data by year and id
death_penalty_df %<>% arrange(year, id)

# Clean up type of crime
death_penalty_df$crime %<>%
  gsub("aid runaway \r\n    slve|accessory to \r\n    mur|consp to \r\n    murder", "accessory to crime", .) %>%
  gsub("rape-theft-robbery|rape-robbery|attempted \r\nrape", "rape", .) %>% 
  gsub("murder-burglary|robbery-murder|theft-murder|kidnap-murder|rape-murder|murder-rape-rob|arson-murder|attempted \r\n    murder", "murder", .) %>%
  gsub("robbery|horse \r\nstealing|theft-stealing", "theft/robbery", .) %>%
  gsub("housebrkng-burgl|burg-att rape", "burglary", .) %>%
  gsub("guerilla \r\n    activit", "guerilla activity", .) %>%  
  gsub("sodmy-buggry-bst", "buggery/bestiality", .) %>% 
  gsub("unspec felony", "other", .) %>% 
  gsub("spying-espionage", "spying/espionage", .) %>% 
  gsub("murder", "(attempted) murder", .) %>%
  gsub("rape", "(attempted) rape", .) 

# Clean up race
death_penalty_df$race %<>% gsub("nat amer", "native american", .)
```
  
## Downloading and importing US shapefiles

US shapefiles can be obtained from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_maftiger.html">Census Bureauâ€™s MAF/TIGER geographic database</a>. For both the standard choropleth and the hexagonal map I chose state-level shapefiles and cropped them the geographic extent of Continental US.

To import the shapefiles, either download `cb_2014_us_state_5m.zip` manually, unzip it and load `cb_2014_us_state_5m.shp` into `R` or simply use this automated code:

```r
# Download, unzip and import US shapefiles from USCB webpage
temp <- tempfile()
download.file("http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2014/shp/cb_2014_us_state_5m.zip", temp, mode = "w")
unzip(temp)
US_shp <- readShapeSpatial("cb_2014_us_state_5m.shp", proj4string = CRS("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84"))
unlink(temp)

# Crop country border to Continental US extent
US_shp_cropped <- crop(US_shp, extent(-124.848974, -66.885444, 24.396308, 49.384358)) 
```

## Mapping executions with *tmap*

The following choropleth map, which depicts the US states shaded in relation to the number of executions, was created with `tmap`.

Note that *no data* could either mean that there is no data available or there actually were no executions carried out during the considered period. See <a href="http://deathpenaltyusa.org/usa1/indexstate1.htm">deathpenaltyusa.org</a> for more information on which years the raw data for each state covers.

```r
# Count deaths by state
deaths_sum <- death_penalty_df %>% count(state)

# First letter to uppercase for joining
deaths_sum$state <- gsub("^(\\w)(\\w+)", "\\U\\1\\L\\2", deaths_sum$state, perl = TRUE)

# Left_join data by state
US_shp_cropped@data <- left_join(US_shp_cropped@data, deaths_sum, by = c("NAME" = "state"))

# Set color palette
## Source: http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/170249/Vampyrism
pal <- c("#D3AF8E", "#7A0E0E", "#5A0B0B", "#380606", "#201B1B")

# Map number of executions in each state
map <- tm_shape(US_shp_cropped) +
  tm_fill(col = "n", palette = pal, auto.palette.mapping = FALSE, breaks = c(1, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500),
          textNA = "No data", title = "No. of executions", text.size = "AREA", style = "fixed") +
  tm_text("STUSPS", size = "AREA", root = 4) +
  tm_borders(col = "white") +
  tm_credits("1801-1900", size = 0.8, position = c("left", "bottom")) +
  tm_legend(legend.outside = TRUE, position = c("right", "center")) #+
map

save_tmap(map, "Executions_1801-1900.png", width = 1460, height = 615) 
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lhehnke/lhehnke.github.io/master/img/death-penalty/Executions_1801-1900.png" width="652px" height="260x" vspace="50px"/></p>

## Mapping executions with *geogrid*

With the `geogrid` package you can go one step further and turn spatial polygons into hexagonal (or regular, for that matter) grids in two steps: 1. Generate the grid with `calculate_grid()`. 2. Use an algorithm to efficiently calculate the assignments from the original geography to the new geography. 

For demonstrations purposes, the following code snippet is adapted from Joseph's <a href="https://github.com/jbaileyh/geogrid#example">sample code</a>.

```r
# Calculate hexagonal grid
new_cells_hex <- calculate_grid(shape = US_shp_cropped, grid_type = "hexagonal", seed = 1)
result_hex <- assign_polygons(US_shp_cropped, new_cells_hex)

# Function for tidying SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
clean <- function(shape) {
  shape@data$id = rownames(shape@data)
  shape.points = fortify(shape, region="id")
  shape.df = merge(shape.points, shape@data, by="id")
}

result_hex_df <- clean(result_hex)

# Hexagon plot
ggplot(result_hex_df) +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = n, group = group), color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(V1, V2, label = STUSPS), size = 5, color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = pal, name = "No. of executions,\n1801-1900") + 
  theme_void() + theme(legend.position = "right") +
  coord_equal() 

ggsave("Executions_1801-1900_hex.png", width = 15, height = 6, units = "in", dpi = 100)
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lhehnke/lhehnke.github.io/master/img/death-penalty/Executions_1801-1900_hex.png" width="652px" height="260x" vspace="50px"/></p>

## Visualizing executions over time

The number of executions over time were plotted using `geom_line()` from `ggplot2`. I manually generated the breaks on the x-axis as I wanted the line to end in 1900, with the breaks being formed once every 10 years (except for the last one).

```r
# Set theme for visualizations
viz_theme <- theme(
  strip.background = element_rect(colour = "grey20", fill = "#92a1a9"),
  axis.line = element_line(colour = "grey20"),
  panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.border = element_blank(),
  panel.background = element_blank(),
  strip.text = element_text(size = rel(1), face = "bold"),
  plot.caption = element_text(colour = "#4e5975"),
  text = element_text(family = "Avenir"))

# Count executions by year
death_penalty_ts <- death_penalty_df %>% count(year) 

# Add 01-01 to year due to missing values in month/day
death_penalty_ts$year <- as.Date(paste0(death_penalty_ts$year, '-01-01'))

# Set 10 year breaks and manually add 1900
breaks <- death_penalty_ts$year[seq(1, length(death_penalty_ts$year), 10)]
breaks <- append(breaks, as.Date("1900-01-01"))

# Plot timeline
ggplot(death_penalty_ts, aes(year, n)) +
  geom_line(col = "#380606", size = 1) + 
  scale_x_date(breaks = breaks, date_labels = "%Y") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Count", title = "Number of executions in the US over time, 1801-1900", subtitle = " ") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) + 
  viz_theme + ylim(0, 150)

ggsave("plot.png", width = 12, height = 8, units = "in", dpi = 100)
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lhehnke/lhehnke.github.io/master/img/death-penalty/plot1.png" width="600px" height="500px" vspace="50px"/></p>

## Visualizing executions by attributes

The last couple of plots depict the number of executions by crime, sex, race, and method. Since they're quite self-explanatory, I won't go further into the details here and leave you alone with them.

```r
# Plot executions by crime
death_penalty_df %>%  
  count(crime, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(crime = reorder(crime, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(crime, n, label = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#380606", col = "#7A0E0E", width = 0.5, alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_text(color = "#380606", hjust = -0.5, size = 4) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) + 
  labs(x = "Crime", y = "Count", title = "Number of executions in the US by crime, 1801-1900", subtitle = " ") +
  viz_theme + ylim(0, 6000) + coord_flip()

# Plot executions by sex
death_penalty_df %>%  
  count(sex, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(sex = reorder(sex, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sex, n, label = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#380606", col = "#7A0E0E", width = 0.5, alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_text(color = "#380606", vjust = -0.5, size = 4) +
  labs(x = "Sex", y = "Count", title = "Number of executions in the US by sex, 1801-1900", subtitle = " ") +
  viz_theme + ylim(0, 6000)

# Plot executions by race
death_penalty_df %>%  
  count(race, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(race = reorder(race, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(race, n, label = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#380606", col = "#7A0E0E", width = 0.5, alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_text(color = "#380606", vjust = -0.5, size = 4) +
  labs(x = "Race", y = "Count", title = "Number of executions in the US by race, 1801-1900", subtitle = " ") +
  viz_theme + ylim(0, 6000) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, vjust = 0.5))

# Plot executions by method
death_penalty_df %>%  
  count(method, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(method = reorder(method, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(method, n, label = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#380606", col = "#7A0E0E", width = 0.5, alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_text(color = "#380606", vjust = -0.5, size = 4) +
  labs(x = "Method", y = "Count", title = "Number of executions in the US by method, 1801-1900", subtitle = " ") +
  viz_theme + ylim(0, 6000) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, vjust = 0.5))
```
