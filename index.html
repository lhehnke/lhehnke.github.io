	<p class="lead">Hello, Reader!</p>

	<p>I'm Lisa and I dedicate most of my time to making a difference by driving social and organizational change.</p> 
	
	<p>After graduating from university, I ventured into academia as a researcher and lecturer but soon realized that I was more passionate about connecting with people and solving real-world challenges than my h-index. Fast forward a few years and I've co-directed a social start-up with the mission to build decentralized open source software, used data for good as a core team member, team and project lead at <a href="https://correlaid.org" target="_blank">CorrelAid</a>, and served as a steering committee member of the <a href="https://opensciencemooc.eu/" target="_blank">Open Science MOOC</a> to openly share scientific knowledge.</p> 
	
	<p>These diverse experiences across industries led to my current occupation as a trained mediator and consultant with a focus on digital transformation processes in the public sector. Beyond that, I'm strangely curious about the mechanisms behind aviation accidents, would invite Leonardo da Vinci and Amelia Earhart over for dinner, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dataplanes" target="_blank">advocate</a> for doing the right thing.</p>

	<p>As a freelancer I support purpose-driven organizations in tapping the potential of their data to gain actionable insights and develop human-centered strategies to maximize their impact. I also give paid and pro bono talks and workshops on data-related topics as I strongly believe that people rather than numbers foster change. If you're interested in teaming up and tackling social or organizational challenges together, <a href="https://lhehnke.github.io/contact/">let me know</a> and we can discuss potential solutions.</p>
