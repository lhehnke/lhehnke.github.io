	<p class="lead">Hello, Reader!</p>

	<p>I'm Lisa and I dedicate most of my time to making a difference by driving social and organizational change.</p> 
	
	<p>After graduating from university, I ventured into academia as a researcher and lecturer but soon realized that I was more passionate about solving real-world problems and connecting with people than my h-index. Fast forward a few years and I've co-directed a social start-up with the mission to build decentralized open source software, used data for good as a core team member, team and project lead at <a href="https://correlaid.org/en/" target="_blank">CorrelAid</a>, and served as a steering committee member of the <a href="https://opensciencemooc.eu/" target="_blank">Open Science MOOC</a> to openly share scientific knowledge. After a brief stint as a public sector consultant, I currently lead an innovation project at <a href="https://www.tafel.de/projekte/tafel-macht-zukunft-gemeinsam-digital/" target="_blank">Tafel Deutschland</a> to shape the future of food donations through digital solutions.</p> 
	
	<p>These diverse experiences sparked my interest in developing solutions to complex problems that build bridges between sectors, industries, and stakeholders to co-create value for the greater good. By adopting a holistic view and bringing together scientific methods with human-centered design, I reframe problems as opportunities and make use of integrative thinking to connect ideas and, ideally, people. Beyond that, I'm strangely curious about the mechanisms behind aviation accidents, would invite Leonardo da Vinci and Amelia Earhart over for dinner, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dataplanes" target="_blank">advocate</a> for doing the right thing.</p>

	<p>As a freelance consultant and data scientist I help purpose-driven organizations create a better world by combining analytics and creative problem solving to gain actionable insights from data and develop (digital) strategies. I also give paid and pro bono talks and workshops on data-related topics and agile project management as I strongly believe that people rather than numbers facilitate change. If you're interested in teaming up and tackling social or organizational challenges together, <a href="https://lhehnke.github.io/contact/">let me know</a> and we can discuss potential solutions.</p>
